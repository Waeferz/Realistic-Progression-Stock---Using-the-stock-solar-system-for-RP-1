Realistic-Progression-Stock - Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1
Realistic Progression Stock is an experimental modification of RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) to convert the contracts from using RSS (Real Solar System) to make them use the stock system with OPM (Outer Planets Mod) and MPE (Minor Planets Expansion).

THIS MODIFICATION OF RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL-EXPECT BUGS-(As of writing this this mod may not work at all as I haven't properly tested it.)

IFYOU ENCOUNTER BUGS PLEASE REPORT THEM TO-https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-Stock---Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1/issues

THIS MOD ALTERS ALMOST ALL CONTRACTS TO FIT AROUND THE STOCK SYSTEM (Specifically at 10-10.625x scale, but smaller multipliers and the original stock system could work, Just Unbalanced)
AS ORIGINAL RP-1 REQUIRES RSS AND THIS USES THE STOCK SYSTEM MANY OUTER PLANET CONTRACTS REQUIRE OPM AND MPE (Outer Planets Mod and Minor Planets Expansion)

Currently all that has been done is the stock RP-1 contracts being converted to the Kerbol Systems counterparts (and where there isn't an counterpart I used a similar/fitting body either from the looks or size e.g. Tal from OPM

As Stated before this mod of RP-1 requires OPM and MPE, It also Requires all the requirements of RP-1 and RO/RP-1 Express Install (Excluding RSS and Parallax 2.0 as Continued is more Optimised and reliable for stock)
