Realistic-Progression-Stock - Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1 
Realistic Progression Stock (RP-S) is an experimental modification of RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) to convert the contracts from using RSS (Real Solar System) to make them use the stock system with OPM (Outer Planets Mod) and MPE (Minor Planets Expansion).

THIS MODIFICATION OF RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL-EXPECT BUGS-(As of writing this I have only minorly tested it)

IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS PLEASE REPORT THEM TO-https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-Stock---Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1/issues

This mod alters all Current RP-1 Contracts, Programmes and Newspaper to fit around the Stock Kerbol System (With OPM and MPE, Specifically at 10-10.625x scale, but smaller multipliers and the original stock system could work, Just may be unbalanced due to RO's Thrust to Weight ratios)

Currently all that has been done is the stock RP-1 contracts being converted to the Kerbol Systems counterparts (and where there isn't an counterpart I used a similar/fitting body either from the looks or size e.g. Tal from OPM)- NO NEW CONTRACTS YET (as of RP-S v1.1)

THE MOD CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM HERE ---> https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-Stock---Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1/releases  Via The releases or the Linked Google Drive

As Stated before this mod of RP-1 requires OPM and MPE, It also Requires all the requirements of RP-1 and RO/RP-1 Express Install (Excluding RSS and Parallax 2.0 as Continued is more Optimised and reliable for stock)

TO INSTALL, DELETE THE FOLDERS THAT ARE NAMED THE SAME AS THE FOLDERS IN THIS ZIP LOCATED IN...Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\RP-1 THEN COPY OVER THE FOLDERS IN THE RP-S v1.1 FOLDER AND PLACE THEM IN the RP-1 FOLDER
